I am an academic researcher with multi-disciplinary experience in areas of computer science, engineering and music technology.
My research interests include artificial intelligence / reinforcement learning, computational creativity, music information retrieval, human-computer interaction, robotics & automation systems, optimisation, sensors / computer vision, The Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, and electronic music production. I am passionate about scientific research and technology and their impact and intersection with areas such as sustainability, politics, music, art and culture.

I am currently a PhD Student at Queen Mary University of London in the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) researching user-driven deep music generation in digital audio workstations, in collaboration with Sony CSL and under the supervision of [Mathieu Barthet](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/barthetmathieu.html) and [Stefan Lattner](https://csl.sony.fr/member/stefan-lattner-phd/). I previously received an MSc. by Research in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Swansea University in 2022 for research into deep reinforcement learning for a collaborative robotic manufacturing task, and a First Class BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool in 2018.

From 2018 to 2023, I was a Research Assistant in the [ASTUTE (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies)](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/engineering/astute/) operation at Swansea University, where I undertook collaborative research, development, and innovation projects with manufacturing companies across Wales in the remit of Industry 4.0. concepts including AI, robotics, and manufacturing systems engineering.

In 2024, I served as the Chief AI Officer for [Mariposa AI](https://mariposa.app/), a start-up developing an AI-assisted slow dating app.

Outside of research, I am also an electronic music producer and DJ performing under the name [Zinger](https://soundcloud.com/djzinger).
