I am a PhD Student at Queen Mary University of London in the [https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/](UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music) researching user-driven deep music generation in digital audio workstations, in collaboration with Sony CSL and under the supervision of [https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/people/profiles/barthetmathieu.html](Mathieu Barthet) and [https://csl.sony.fr/member/stefan-lattner-phd/](Stefan Lattner).

I received an MSc. by Research in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Swansea University in 2022 for research into deep reinforcement learning for robotic aerospace manufacturing, and a First Class BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool in 2018.

From 2018 to 2023, I was a Research Assistant in the [https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/engineering/astute/](ASTUTE (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies)) operation at Swansea University, where I undertook collaborative research, development, and innovation projects with manufacturing companies across Wales in the remit of Industry 4.0. concepts including AI, robotics, and manufacturing systems engineering.

My research interests include artificial intelligence, computational creativity for electronic dance music, music information retrieval, robotics and industrial automation, human-computer interaction, industry 4.0, and the Internet of Things.
